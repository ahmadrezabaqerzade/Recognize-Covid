At first we use 3 models and then we use them for forth part that it use them to decide. In forth part that certain a one linear neural network we concat 3  outputs from models and we concat them and we give it to linear part. As we said we have 3 models that certain two part CNN and one part Transformer. In Transformer part we see that model is better than CNN part. Finally we see that using ensemble learning can be usfully for train a our samll dataset and loss reduce significantly. In forth part we forced to train a finally model with more epochs and more times to get a good score but we could train more epoch to get a better score.
